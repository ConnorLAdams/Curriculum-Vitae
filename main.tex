{Cal Poly Pomona}
{Discovered the closed form for computing the eigenvalues for a specific type of tridiagonal
matrix. 
Explored finding the solutions of a system using Gauss-Elimination w/o pivot, Gauss-Elimination w/ partial pivot, and LU factorization to name a few. 
Results showed that LU factorization and Gauss-Elimination w/o pivot were the best methods because of their efficiency with large tridiagonal matrices.}
